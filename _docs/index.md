## Introduction

[Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)](https://marinebon.org) 
observation data is focused on organisms from microbes to whales, including measures of biodiversity 
(e.g. presence, abundance), productivity, genomics, phenology, and other relevant ecological process 
measurements or indices. Also featured are habitat characterization and habitat diversity measures, 
including satellite data and added-value data derived from satellite observations, and neural network 
model results, such as biogeographical seascape classifications.

The data have been generated within the MBON regions of the Arctic, Central California, Southern 
California, the Gulf of Maine, the Pacific Northwest, and South Florida. Data have been collected 
by associated scientists or provided by multiple other independent programs, such as the IOOS Regional 
Associations, Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) programs, universities, and other fisheries or marine wildlife 
institutions.

This document describes the recommendations for formatting and sharing data and metadata for the MBON community. 

For help with the MBON Data Portal, please see the [MBON portal help documentation](https://mbon.ioos.us/help/).
